There are new developments in neural network architectures, novel applications, better optimization techniques, theoretical results justifying why something works etc. daily.

    "pytorch provides a DataLoader class that makes it easy to generate batches from your dataset.\n",

    "**Optional**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze how using batches can be different from using the full dataset. Suppose our data has 10,000 rows but we use batches of size 100 (usually we pick powers of 2 for the GPU but this is just an example). Statistically, our goal is always to compute the gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all the weights $w_i$. By weights here, I mean both the weights and biases and any other free or tunable parameters in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the loss is a sum over all the examples in our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = \\frac{1}{N}\\Sigma_{i}^N l(p_i, t_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ = prediction for ith example, $t_i$ = target/label for ith example. So the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_i} = \\frac{1}{N}\\Sigma_i^N \\frac{\\partial l(p_i, t_i)}{\\partial w_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, our goal is to calculate this quantity but $N$ is too large. So we pick a randomly chosen subset of size 100 and only average the gradients over those examples. As an analogy, if our task was to measure the average height of all the people in the world which is impractical, we would pick randomly chosen subsets, say of 10,000 people and measure their average heights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, as we make the subset smaller, the estimate we get will be noisier i.e. it has a greater chance of higher deviation from the actual value (height or gradient). Is this good or bad? It depends. In our case, we are optimizing a function (the loss) that has multiple local minima and saddle points. It is easy to get stuck in regions of the loss space/surface. Having noisy gradients can help with escaping those local minima just because we'll not always be moving in the direction of the true gradient but a noisy estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used terminology in case you read papers/articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Full) Gradient Descent - compute the gradients over the full dataset. Memory-intensive for larger datasets. This is what we did with our toy examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mini-batch Gradient Descent - use randomly chosen samples of fixed size as your data. Noisier gradients, more frequent updates to your model, memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stochastic Gradient Descent - Mini-batch gradient descent with batch size = 1. Very noisy estimate, \"online\" updates to your model, can be hard to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some fascinating papers on more theoretical investigations into the loss surface and the behavior of gradient descent. Here are some examples:\n",

    "* Pytorch's functions like nn.ReLU() and nn.MaxPool2d() return functions that can apply operations. So, nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2) returns a function that is then applied to the argument above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chaining together the layers and activations and testing them out like above is very valuable as the first step in ensuring your network does what you want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we would suggest the following steps when you are expressing a new network architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build up your network using nn.Sequential if you are just assembling existing or user-defined layers, or by defining a new network class inheriting from nn.Module where you can define a custom forward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick a small tensor containing your features and pass it through each step/layer. Ensure the dimensions of the input and output tensors to each layer make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick your loss and optimizer and train on a small batch. You should be able to overfit i.e. get almost zero loss on this small set. Neural networks are extremely flexible learners and if you can't overfit on a small batch, you either have a bug or need to add some more capacity (more nodes, more layers etc. -> more weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now you should train on the full train set and practice the usual cross-validation practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probe your model: add noise to the inputs, see where the model isn't performing well, make partial dependency plots etc. to understand characteristics of your model. This part can be very open-ended and it depends on what your final aim is. If you are building a model to predict the stock price so you can trade, you'll spend a lot of time in this step. If you are having fun predicting dogs vs cats, maybe you don't care so much. If your aim is to dive deeper into deep learning, looking at the weights, activations, effect of changing hyperparameters, removing edges/weights etc. are very valuable experiments."

We could do N pixel-by-pixel matches but these won't work because even a slight change in position or orientation or pixel intensities will give misleading distances between images.
